          Hello there, my name is Krishna Panthi. I'm a graduate student and
          research assistant at Clemson University. I have a deep passion for
          learning and problem-solving. I've dabbled in deep reinforcement
          learning, computer vision, time series analysis, software development,
          quantum computing, and high-performance computing. What I like the
          most is writing code and producing results. The best part is I usually
          don't care about the type of programming language used. I've written
          code in Python, C#, JavaScript, TypeScript, C++, Java, SQL, Dart,
          (HTML + CSS), and PHP. That being said, I have most of my experience
          in Python, C#, JavaScript, (HTML + CSS), and SQL. With all these
          experiences, I'm confident that I can work with any modern programming
          language. Additionally, my friends say I've got a good sense of humor.
        </p>

        <p>TL;DR: I enjoy learning, building, and making people laugh.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                Developed AquaCrop-Richards, a new crop simulation model that
                integrates the Richards equation AquaCrop. I wrote a numerical
                solver for 1-D Richards Equation. It was solved using finite
                difference method and modified Picard iteration. I also
                implemented Anderson Acceleration to make it converge in fewer
                Picard iterations.
              </li>
              <li>
                There after, I implemented deep reinforcement learning methods
                (PPO, DQN, SLBO) to optimize irrigation to obtain maximum profit
                using the AquaCrop-Richards as the learning environment.

              <li>
                I was involved in implementation of HydroQuantum library to do

        </h5>
        This project represents a collaborative effort between the Better Future Institute (BFI) of San Antonio and Clemson University. The primary dataset consisted of 311 non-emergency service requests collected over a 14-month period, which was provided to the research team. This dataset was subsequently enriched with demographic and socio-economic data for San Antonio, sourced from the U.S. Census Bureau, to facilitate a comprehensive analysis.

        This research implements Exact Diffusion Inversion via Coupled Transformation (EDICT) with the Gaussian Shading watermarking technique in diffusion models. The results show a slight improvement in the performance of Gaussian Shading. The implementation is tested on manipulated images after watermarking, and results in the table below shows better performance for most image manipulation methods, except for ColorJitter and Salt &amp; Pepper Noise. For more details, please refer to our paper.
