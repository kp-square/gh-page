# This one morning I woke up and suddenly realized how special I am!
\
As a professional programmer, AI has taken away my sleep. You see, coding was this special skill that used to be unique, that few were capable of doing, until AI came along. And I have this persistent fear of what will become of my profession and future. As a result, I find myself thinking about AI even during my sleep.

So that morning, I was thinking about AI progress and whether it might be possible for AI to become something like us, to have goals or desires like we do. In other words, to become self-aware.

Then I started thinking about consciousness. Self-awareness and consciousness may mean different things, I don't know, but to me, at that time, they felt the same. One thing led to another, and then it suddenly hit me that quite a lot of things in the observable universe are not conscious at all, leading me to question: we are conscious, but how? Is it because somehow one event followed another and went through a long process of experimentation where things combined together to form new things with different properties. The process repeated numerous times to eventually create self-aware, replicating beings like us from something that is non-living and unaware. It felt absurd, amazing and unbelievable at the same time.

Like, if we look at the basics, it's just those four fundamental forces of physics underlying everything (oversimplifying a lot here). Something that made me a little sad was how we don't think about it often. How we don't often consider how special we are, that we can perceive, see, and feel. It's such a rare thing. At that moment, I realized how special I am and that I can feel special just by thinking about my own existence.
