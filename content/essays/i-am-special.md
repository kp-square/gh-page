# This one morning I woke up and suddenly realized how special I am!
\
As a professional programmer, AI had taken away my sleep. You see, coding was this special skill that used to be unique, that few were capable of doing, until AI came in. And I had this innate fear of what would become of my profession and future. As a result, I was thinking about AI even during my sleep. So, that morning, I was thinking about AI progress and if it might be possible for AI to become something like us, means to have goals or desires like we do. In other words, to become self-aware.

Then I started thinking about consciousness. Self-awareness and consciousness may mean different things, I don’t know but to me, at that time, they felt the same. One thing led to another, and then it suddenly hit me that quite a lot of things in the observable universe are not conscious at all, leading me to question myself: we are conscious, but how? Because somehow one event followed another and went through a long process of experiments where stuff combined together to form new things with different properties. The processes repeated numerous times to make a self-aware, replicating being like us. How amazing is that?

Like, if we look at the basics, it’s just those four laws of physics underlying everything (oversimplifying a bit). A thing that made me a little sad was how we don’t think about it often — how we don’t often think about how special we are, that we can perceive, see, or feel. It’s such a rare thing. At that moment, I realized how special I am and that I can just feel happy and special just by thinking about my own existence.
